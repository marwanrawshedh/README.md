## Describe “The Cloud”
- Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center.
## What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
- is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
## What is auto-scaling?
- Autoscaling, also spelled auto scaling or auto-scaling, and sometimes also called automatic scaling, is a method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the farm. 
## What is bandwidth?
- In computing, bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. Bandwidth may be characterized as network bandwidth, data bandwidth, or digital bandwidth
## How do cloud providers compute service costs?
- They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor.


# Term
- Server Instances:s a virtual machine which runs our workloads in the cloud
- Containers:is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
- Cloud Services: a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware.
- Cloud Architecture:the technology components that are combined to build a cloud, where resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network.
- AWS:Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.
- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku:Heroku is best suitable for Startups, Medium Businesses whereas AWS is mainly focused on Medium Businesses and Large Enterprises. Heroku can meet low computational demands whereas AWS can meet high/very high computational demands

## Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can store and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case, such as data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile apps.

## What is AWS Lambda?
- AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.
## How does AWS Lambda work?
- Each Lambda function runs in its own container. When a function is created, Lambda packages it into a new container and then executes that container on a multi-tenant cluster of machines managed by AWS. Before the functions start running, each function’s container is allocated its necessary RAM and CPU capacity. Once the functions finish running, the RAM allocated at the beginning is multiplied by the amount of time the function spent running.
## A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.
