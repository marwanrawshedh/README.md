# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

## What is functional programming?

### Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

### the function which returns the same result if given the same arguments

## What are the benefits of a pure function? 

### The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts

## What is immutability?

### state cannot change after it’s created. 

## What is Referential transparency?

### pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

## What is a module?

### the blocks of encapsulated code that communicates with an external application on the basis of their related functionality

## What does the word ‘require’ do?

### The require() method is used to load and cache JavaScript modules.

## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

### we can use require after that we have to call the variable that we assigned it.

## What do we have to do to make a module available?

### to make your module available you have to export it by `module.exports=the element you want to export`
