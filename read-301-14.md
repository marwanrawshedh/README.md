# Authentication

## What is OAuth?

### open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential.

## Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.

### The simplest example of OAuth is when you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon. 

## How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?



## What is OpenID?

- The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.
- The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.
- The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.
- The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).
- If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.
- The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.
- The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token)
- The user gives the approved access token to the first website.
- The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.
- The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.
- The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.
- OAuth is not the first authentication/authorization system to work this way behalf of the end-user.


## What is the difference between authorization and authentication?

### Authentication confirms that users are who they say they are. Authorization gives those users permission to access a resource

## What is Authorization Code Flow?

### is used to obtain an access token to authorize API requests

## What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?

### an OpenId Connect flow specifically designed to authenticate native or mobile application users

## What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?

###  This flow is considered best practice when using Single Page Apps (SPA) or Mobile Apps.
