# errors in javascript

## we have to know how javascript work to know how the mistakes happen

## EXECUTION CONTEXT

### Every statement in a script lives in one of three execution contexts  

- GLOBAL CONTEXT `There is only one global context in any page.`
- FUNCTION CONTEXT `Each function has its own function context.`
- EVAL CONTEXT

## SCOPE

- GLOBAL SCOPE `If a variable is declared outside a function, it can be used anywhere because it has global scope.`
- FUNCTION-LEVEL SCOPE `When a variable is declared within a function, it can only be used within that function.`

## HOISTING

## what do you maen by ***HOISTING***

### it is Calling functions before they have been declared (if they were created using function declarations )

### Assign a value to a variable that has not yet been declared

## why we can call the function or assign a value to a variable before create them?

### `This is because any variables and functions within each execution context are created before they are executed.`

## the best exanple for functions scope is `If a variable is not found in the variables object for the current execution context, it can look in the variables object of the parent execution context.`
