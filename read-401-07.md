## Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms) 
### is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance.
### It contains static variables that can accommodate unique and private instances of itself. It is used in scenarios when a user wants to restrict instantiation of a class to only one object.
## Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes?
### as a manager object between the instances of other objects, thus there should be only one instance of the singleton 
## If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
### create function middelware and insert this function in the target route . 
# terms
## router middleware: is a middelware function represint as a route
## CRUD -> REST Method Matches: CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are four primitive database operations. 
## mock test:creating a fake version of an external or internal service that can stand in for the real one, helping your tests run more quickly and more reliably.

`Passwords are the first line of defense against cyber criminals`
## Hashing is the greatest way for protecting passwords and considered to be pretty safe for ensuring the integrity of data or password.
## The benefit of hashing is that if someone steals the database with hashed passwords, they only make off with the hashes and not the actual plaintext passwords.

## PROBLEMS WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH ALGORITHM
- Brute Force attack:Hashes can't be reversed, so instead of reversing the hash of the password, an attacker can simply keep trying different inputs until he does not find the right now that generates the same hash value, called brute force attack.
- Hash Collision attack: Hash functions have infinite input length and a predefined output length, so there is inevitably going to be the possibility of two different inputs that produce the same output hash.

## This method of hashing passwords is solid enough for most web applications that stores users' passwords and other sensitive data.


# basic access authentication
## basic access authentication: is a method for an HTTP user agent to provide a user name and password when making a request. 
## HTTP Basic authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for enforcing access controls to web resources because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses standard fields in the HTTP header.
## The BA mechanism does not provide confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials. They are merely encoded with Base64 in transit and not encrypted or hashed in any way. Therefore, basic authentication is typically used in conjunction with HTTPS to provide confidentiality.
# Authentication
## Authentication :is the process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be.

## Authentication General Guidelines
- User IDs:Make sure your usernames/user IDs are case-insensitive. Usernames should also be unique. For high-security applications, usernames could be assigned and secret instead of user-defined public data.
- Implement Proper Password Strength Controls:Passwords shorter than 8 characters are considered to be weak,Do not silently truncate passwords,Allow usage of all characters including unicode and whitespace,Ensure credential rotation when a password leak.
