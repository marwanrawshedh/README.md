# ***Forms***

###  HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

### in React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

## controlled component?
### `a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state.`

## how can we make a controlled formed?
### the first thing we should write as a HTML `<form><form?> `after that we should write` <input><input/> <label><label/>` we should give the input attribute like value to keep it update  and after that we should do a contructor with this.state include an assign value  ex name :""   after that we have to create a methode on change that include a setState have the event.target.value.

# condition 
## if statement, allows us to specify that a certain block of code should be executed if a certain condition is met.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator: it is a short and easy why to write the condition ex normal way to write if statment 
`if ( condition ) {`
 ` value if true;`
`} else {`
 ` value if false;}`
 ## Ternary way `condition ? value if true : value if false`
