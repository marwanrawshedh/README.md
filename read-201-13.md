## local storage is one of the areas where native client applications have held an advantage over web applications. 
`In the beginning, there was only Internet Explorer. Or at least, thatâ€™s what Microsoft wanted the world to think. To that end, as part of the First Great Browser Wars, Microsoft invented a great many things and included them in their browser-to-end-all-browser-wars, Internet Explorer. One of these things was called DHTML Behaviors, and one of these behaviors was called userData`
## serData the first storage 
> ### userData allows web pages to store up to 64 KB of data per domain, in a hierarchical XML-based structure.
## HTML5 is a specification named Web Storage
## how can access HTML5 Storage?
### Before you can use it, you should detect whether the browser supports it.
### by `function supports_html5_storage() {try {return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null;} catch (e) { return false;}}`
### HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats.
