## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
### When a client needs to replace an existing Resource entirely, they can use PUT. When they're doing a partial update, they can use HTTP PATCH. 

## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
- Mockable.io
- Mocky.io
- Mockoon




## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

|     |SOAP             |  ReST            |
|     | - | - |
| 1.  |  XML-based message protocol | architectural style  |
| 2.  |  uses WSDL for communication between consumer and provider  |  uses XML or JSON to send and receive data  |
| 3.  |   invokes services by calling RPC method | alls services via URL path  |
| 4.  |  doesn't return human readable result   | return result is readable with is just plain XML or JSON |
| 5.  |  SOAP is not just over HTTP, it also uses other protocols such as SMTP, FTP, etc   | REST is over only HTTP |

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms
## web server:software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web.
## Express:is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.
## WRRC:Web Request Response Cycle it is a cycle how the request sent from the client to the server and gets back to the client with the response.

- platform and library
- ci(continuous integration) cd(continuous deployment)
## Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
- npm
- depuging
- algorithms
## What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
- data structure

## Node: is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. 
## The runtime:ntended for use outside of a browser context (i.e. running directly on a computer or server OS)
## Node has a number of benefits
- Great performance: Node was designed to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications and is a good solution for many common web-development problems (e.g. real-time web applications).
- Code is written in "plain old JavaScript", which means that less time is spent dealing with "context shift" 
- JavaScript is a relatively new programming language and benefits from improvements in language design when compared to other traditional web-server languages (e.g. Python, PHP, etc.) Many other new and popular languages compile/convert into JavaScript so you can also use TypeScript, CoffeeScript, ClojureScript, Scala, LiveScript, etc.
- The node package manager (NPM) provides access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages.
- Node.js is portable. It is available on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, WebOS, and NonStop OS.
- t has a very active third party ecosystem and developer community.

## Express ,is the most popular Node web framework.
### It provides mechanisms to
- Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).
- Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.
-Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.
## npm :is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.
Use npm to
- Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
- Download standalone tools you can use right away
- Share code with any npm user, anywhere.
- Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.
- Restrict code to specific developers.
- Run packages without downloading using npx
## Test-driven development (TDD) refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).
## Benefits 
- reductions in defect rates
- reduction in effort in projects’ final phases
- TDD leads to improved design qualities in the code

### Common Pitfalls
- forgetting to run tests frequently 
- writing too many tests at once
- writing tests that are too large or coarse-grained
- writing tests for trivial code
- writing overly trivial tests

## CD/CI
- CD: is developing softwaer that could be released at any time(that mean updating your new code with other systems about changes)
- CI: is a workflow strategy you can lean on te help you ensure new code will integrate into the current version of the software
