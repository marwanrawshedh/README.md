## What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application? you should use useEffect to load the data from the API on page load. The useEffect should call a function that contains e.preventDefault and a call to the action.

## When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer? You export the async action and that will dispatch the response data to your action which will send the data to the reducer

# Vocabulary Terms
- middleware a piece of software that takes the request data and modifies it before sending it along to the API

- thunk Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.

## Redux Toolkit
### The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

- Configuring a Redux store is too complicated
- I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful
- Redux requires too much boilerplate code
## Advantages :
- Simple Includes utilities to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more.
- Opinionated Provides good defaults for store setup out of the box, and includes the most commonly used Redux addons built-in.
- Powerful Takes inspiration from libraries like Immer and Autodux to let you write “mutative” immutable update logic, and even create entire “slices” of state automatically.
- Effective Lets you focus on the core logic your app needs, so you can do more work with less code.
