# Trees
## Common Terminology
- Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes
- Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a - k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf
##  Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree
## There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

- Depth First: where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.
- Breadth First:traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. 
## breadth first traversal uses a queue (instead of the call stack via recursion) to traverse the width/breadth of the tree. Let’s break down the process.

## Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).
## Because there are no structural rules for where nodes are “supposed to go” in a binary tree, it really doesn’t matter where a new node gets placed.
## Big O
- The Big O time complexity for inserting a new node is O(n). Searching for a specific node will also be O(n).
- The Big O space complexity for a node insertion using breadth first insertion will be O(w), where w is the largest width of the tree. For example, in the above tree, w is 4.
