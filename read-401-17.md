# AWS: Cloud Servers
# Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
## The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app.
- A user opens his browser, types in a URL, and presses Enter.
- When a user presses Enter, the browser makes a request for that URL.
- The request hits the Rails router (config/routes.rb). - The router maps the URL to the correct controller and action to handle the request.
- The action receives the request and passes it on to the view.
- The view renders the page as HTML.
- The controller sends the HTML back to the browser. - The page loads and the user sees it.
# Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
- servers are the point that is receiving the requests and sending the response .
# What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
##  is the process of installing, configuring, and enabling a specific application or set of applications, usually through an application manager (app manager) or software management system, to a specific URL on a server.
 
# Term
- Server:is a computer on a network that manages network resources. Servers are referred to as “dedicated” meaning they are designed to perform a specific task. 
- Pub/Sub :Publish/subscribe messaging, or pub/sub messaging, is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures.
- WRRC: a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers.

# Virtual Machines:is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine
- the benefit of virsual machine:allow you to run an operating system in an app window on your desktop that behaves like a full, separate computer. You can use them play around with different operating systems, run software your main operating system can't, and try out apps in a safe, sandboxed environment.

## ec2
### EC2 is a virtual machine that represents a physical server for you to deploy your applications.
### You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.
