# Data Modeling
## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
- The code is easier to maintain.
- Developers have less debugging to do.
- Code refactoring goes more smoothly.
## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
### beforeEach() :when we want to assign variables or turn on database before tesing(`Use to run a common code before`)
### afterEach() :when we want to rest or drop or variables or database( `that cleanUpDatabase is called after each test runs`)

## What is one downside of Test Driven Development
- The test suite itself has to be maintained; tests may not be completely deterministic
- The tests may be hard to write

## Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?


## Why REST?
- REST is Easy to Understand and Implement
- REST Makes your Application More Scalable
- Caching is Easier with REST
- REST is Flexibile

## functional programming: `to take advantage of language support in using functions as variables, arguments, and return values to create elegant code` programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.
## 00P: writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data (Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Data abstraction).
## class:a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state.
## super:The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
## this:this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.
## TDD: is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
## jest :is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.
## Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.
## REST: is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.
## data modal:explicitly determines the structure of data.


## Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

## What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
- sql relations

## nosql vs sql

| SQL            |  	NoSQL            |
 | - | - |
| table based databases | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
| databases have predefined schema | dynamic schema for unstructured data |
|  vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
|  scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware.  |  scaled by increasing the databases servers  |
|  uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | ocused on collection of documents |


## sequelize: is a promise-based Node.js ORM tool for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.
