# T***ransforms***
### he transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional.
## we can by transform doing a lot of moves that we will show now.
- we can rotat the element 360 degree by `element {transform: rotate(**deg);}`
- we can change the scale decreasing or inceasingby`element {transform: scale(1.3 or0.7......);}`
- we can change specefic scle on x or y by `element {transform: scale y or x(1.3 or 0.7......);}` or both together `element {transform: scale(1.3 ,0.7);}`
- we can move the element by `element {transform: translate y or x(25%);}` or both together  `element {transform: translate (25% , 50%);}`
- we can increace or deacres the scale with rotate by `transform: rotate(**deg) scale(**)`
 

# Transitions
## transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.
- `we can change the color when hover or target the elemen by element {background: old color ;`
`transition-property: background;`
`transition-duration: duration of transition;`
`transition-timing-function: linear;}`
`element :hover {background:new color ;}`
## and alot of property that we can do like `background- colorbackground -positionborder- colorborder -widthborder- spacingbottomclipcolorcropfont- sizefont- weightheightleftletter- spacingline- heightmarginmax-heightmax- widthmin- heightmin- widthopacityoutline- coloroutline- offsetoutline- widthpaddingrighttext-indenttext- shadowtopvertical- alignvisibilitywidthword- spacingz-indexTransition Duration`.
