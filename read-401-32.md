# Context API - Behaviors
## When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?

### I will use the function based component because it will give me more control on the contexts.
## What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?

### Site settings context or theme context.
## How can you best test context?

### Testing the Provider and Consumer Together.
### Testing a component with children that consume Context.
## Term
- context : Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. For example, in the code below we manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component: class App extends React.

- useContext() : “useContext” hook is used to create common data that can be accessed throughout the component hierarchy without passing the props down manually to each level. Context defined will be available to all the child components without involving “props”.

- static context : This rule applies when the static contextType property of a React component is not properly specified. The contextType property is used to consume a context created with React. ... When the property is specified for a React component, you can access the current value of the context using this.
## Context
- Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

## What is a hook and context?
### The hook is called with the context as an argument and returns the user name value. and <Header /> intermediate components don’t have to pass down the userName prop. That is the great benefit of the context: it removes the burden of passing down data through the intermediate components.
