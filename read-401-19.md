# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda
## What are serverless functions?
-  are single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted on managed infrastructure. 
- These functions, which are invoked through the Internet, are hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies.

## Describe how a CDN works
- is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device.

##  Amazon API Gateway: is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic.
## How does API Gateway work?
- API Gateway sits between the backend services of your API and your API’s users, handling the HTTP requests to your API endpoints and routing them to the correct backends. 
## API Types
- RESTful APIs
- WEBSOCKET APIs
##  What is DynamoDB?
- DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
## DynamoDB is a particularly good fit for the following use cases
- Applications with large amounts of data and strict latency requirements.
- Serverless applications using AWS Lambda.
- Data sets with simple, known access patterns.
## Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose, which means if you are coming from Mongoose the syntax will be very familar.
## Key Features#
- Type safety .
- High level API .
- Easy to use syntax .
- Ability to transform data before saving or retrieving documents .
- Strict data modeling (validation, required attributes, and more) .
- Support for DynamoDB Transactions .
- Powerful Conditional/Filtering Support .
- Callback & Promise support .
