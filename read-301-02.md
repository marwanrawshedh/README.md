## State and Props
## react life cycle
### `defined as the series of methods that are invoked in different stages of the componentâ€™s existence. `
### what are these stages of life cycle 
- Initialization: `This is the stage where the component is constructed with the given Props and default state. This is done in the constructor of a Component Class.`
- Mounting:`set up a timer whenever the Clock is rendered to the DOM for the first time`
- Updating:`when the state of a component is updated and the application is repainted.`
- Unmounting:` that timer whenever the DOM produced by the Clock is removed.`

## props
### What Are Props? Props (aka "properties") in React allows us to pass values from a parent component down to a child component.***The values can be any data type, from strings to functions, objects, etc***

## state 
### React has another special built-in object called state, which allows components to create and manage their own data. So unlike props, ***components cannot pass data with state***, but they can create and manage it internally.
