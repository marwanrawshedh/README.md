# Thinking in React
## React is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It has scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram.


## How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?
- you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component
-  a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

## What is the `single responsibility principle` and how does it apply to components?
> ### is a computer-programming principle that states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. All of that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.



## What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

###  that nean building a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It’s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.

## aftter you have a static application, what should thinking how To make your UI interactive

> ### you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with state

## What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
- Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
- Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
- Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
