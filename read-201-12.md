# ***Charts***
## Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables . At first sight a `<canvas>` looks like the `<img>` element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes., the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height
## how can create a chrat in html 
### we can by `<canvas ></canvas>`
