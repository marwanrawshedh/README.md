# Event Driven Architecture
## Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
- Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once. FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it.
## How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
- the user side will  notificate the server that the message is received.
## What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
- Observer pattern
## How do you test an event driven system?
- Service tests for event-driven systems operate on events for inputs and events for outputs and are unaware of other services

# Term
- FIFO Queue:In computing and in systems theory, FIFO an acronym for first in, first out is a method for organizing the manipulation of a data structure where the oldest entry, or "head" of the queue, is processed first.
- Pub/Sub :Publish/subscribe messaging, or pub/sub messaging, is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures.

## Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
- sql relations
- psql
- authentication and authorization
## What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
- hook
# AWS provides servers, storage, networking, remote computing, email, mobile development, and security.
# Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and send notifications from the cloud. 
# Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems
## What are the benefits of using Amazon SNS?

- Instantaneous, push-based delivery (no polling)
- Simple APIs and easy integration with applications
- Flexible message delivery over multiple transport protocols
- Inexpensive, pay-as-you-go model with no up-front costs
- Web-based AWS Management Console offers the simplicity of a point-and-click interface
