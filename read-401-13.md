# Socket.io
## What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
### Data packets are able to find the destination without the use of a dedicated channel. Reduces lost data packets
## UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
###  No connection needs to be established between the source and destination before you transmit data. UDP does not have a mechanism to make sure that the payload is not corrupted.
## Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
### yes it can
## Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
### yes it can
## Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
### You can use the same socket for whatever you want, as long as your protocol handles it.

# Term
- Observer Pattern: is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
- Listener:function in a computer program that waits for an event to occur.
- Event Handler: code that will run when an event fires(functions)
- Event Driven Programming:a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events
- Event Loop:construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program
- Event Queue: a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system.
- Call Stack: is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program
- Emit/Raise/Trigger:an event, which causes all callbacks registered to the event to 'fire'
- database: an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.

## WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
- The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP 
- facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server. 
## This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the client without being first requested by the client, and allowing messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open
## Most browsers support the protocol, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera.

## Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed.

## WebSocket is the communication Protocol that provides bidirectional communication between the Client and the Server over a TCP connection
## Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers. It uses the WebSocket protocol to provide the interface. 
- Client-Side: it is the library that runs inside the browser
- Server Side: It is the library for Node.js

## Key features of WebSocket 

- WebSocket helps in real-time communication between the Client and the webserver.
- This protocol helps in transforming to cross-platform in a real-time world between the server and the client.
- This also enables the business worldwide for a real-time web application to enhance and increase the feasibility.
- The major advantage it stands over an HTTP connection that it provides full-duplex communication.


## Why do we need WebSocket?

- It provides full-duplex communication, which helps in persisting the connection established between the Client and the Web Server.
- It also lives up to the standards and provides the accuracy and efficiency stream events to and from with negligible latency.
WebSocket removes the overhead and reduce complexity.
- It makes real-time communication effortless and efficient.

## Key features of Socket.IO
- It helps in broadcasting to multiple sockets at a time and handles the connection transparently.
- It works on all platform, server or device, ensuring equality, reliability, and speed.
- It automatically upgrades the requirement to WebSocket if needed.
- It is a custom real-time transport protocol implementation on top of other protocols.
- It requires both libraries to be used Client side as well as a server-side library.
- IO works on work-based events. 
There are some Client based reserved events like Connect, connect- error, connect-timeout and Reconnect etc.
