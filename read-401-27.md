# useState() Hook
## How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS
### JS apps usually start with the initial UI created on the server (as HTML), whereas React apps start with a blank HTML page, and dynamically create the initial state in JavaScript. React requires you to break your UI into components, but plain JS apps can be structured in any way you see fit.
## What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component react?
### A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element. There is no render method used in functional components

## Term
- functional components : is a function that takes props and returns JSX. They do not have state or lifecycle methods. Functional components are easier to read, debug, and test. They offer performance benefits, decreased coupling, and greater reusability.
- Children / Child Components: is a independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

## What is a Hook? A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We’ll learn other Hooks later.

## When would I use a Hook? If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component. 

- useState:It declares a “state variable”
- useEffect:By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. 
- useReducer: is used for complex state manipulations and state transitions
- useMemo:allows you to memoize expensive functions so that you can avoid calling them on every render.
- useCallback: you have a component in which the child is rerendering again and again without need.
