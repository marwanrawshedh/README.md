# Component Lifecycle / useEffect() Hook
## Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
- A React app consists of a single HTML file index.html . The views are coded in JSX format as components.
## If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
### Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />
## What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested
- it will hide the last component
## What does props.children contain?
- it contain the passing data from the parent to the children 
## How do useState() and this.setState() differ?
- useState: we use it when we write a functional component 
- this.setState(): we use it when we write the class component

# Term
- State Hook:that allows you to have state variables in functional components.
- Mounting:is alifcycle  phase in which our React component mounts on the DOM.
- Un-Mounting: lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM.


# useEffect
## What does useEffect do?
-  By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. 
## Does useEffect run after every render? 
- Yes! By default, it runs both after the first render and after every update.
