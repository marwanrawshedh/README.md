# six Reasons for Pair Programming

## What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

- `Greater efficiency  Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product).`
- `Engaged collaboration the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. It is harder to procrastinate or get off track`
- `Learning from fellow students working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.`
- `Social skills Pair programming is great for improving social skills`
- `Job interview readiness`
- `Work environment readiness`
