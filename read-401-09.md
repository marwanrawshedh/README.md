## When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
- Basic Authorization: Auth is a standardized way to send credentials.
- Bearer Authorization:It is the recommended Authentication methods whenever possible. It is ideal when scripting, when developing external app or when doing integration with external tools.
## What does the JSON Web Token package do?
- check if the token is compatible with the signature or not.
## What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
- Differentiate Between Secrets and Identifiers. ...
- Establish a Circle of Trust. ...
- Gain Visibility into the Chain of Trust. ...
- Encrypt Data Using a KMS. ...
- Rotate Secrets Frequently. ...
- Automate Password Creation. ...
- Store Secrets Responsibly. ...
- Detect Unauthorized Access.

## encryption:method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning
## token: similar to a password and allows you to authenticate to Dataverse Software APIs to perform actions as you.
## bearer:an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens.
## secret :is a signature that bearer use it to know who is authorized
## token:is a proposed Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims.

# RBAC
## RBAC :is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization. It's important to remember that not every employee needs a starring role.


## RBAC :is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is an approach to implement mandatory access control .
## Benefits of RBAC?
### With the proper implementation of RBAC
- the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. 
- much easier to audit user rights.
- much easier to correct any issues identified.
- make the ongoing management of access rights much easier and more secure.

# Access control lists (ACL): is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document. 
## ex ACL could be used to allow users from one department to make changes to a document, while only allowing users from other departments to read the document.

#  five-step approach to getting RBAC  implemented
- Inventory your systems
- Analyze your workforce and create roles :Avoid the temptation to have too many roles defined 
- Assign people to roles 
- Never make one-off changes:Resist any temptation to make a one-off change for an employee with unusual needs. 
- Audit :Periodically review your roles, the employees assigned to them, and the access permitted for each. If you discover, for example, that a role has unnecessary access to a particular system, change the role and adjust the access level for all employees in that role. 

- access control lists (ACLs) are used in traditional discretionary access-control systems to affect low-level data-objects.
- RBAC differs from ACL in assigning permissions to operations which change the direct-relations between several entities.
