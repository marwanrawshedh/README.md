## Common mistakes when you solve a proplem
- ### the improper allocation of time.
- ### try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code assoon as possible.
### You must resist this urge.

### You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.

### Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.  Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.

## A simple set of steps
- Read the problem completely twice.
- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
- Optimize the manual steps.
- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
- Optimize the real code.

## Act like you make $1000/hr

### Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000.
- What would your life look like?
- What people would you stop putting up with?
- What problems would you stop wasting time on?
- What things would you stop — and start — doing?
- Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.

## How to think like a programmer
### So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?
### Understand
### How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

### Plan
### Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!
### Divide
### Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

### Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
### Stuck?

### Practice
### Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

## 5 Whys
### Assemble a Team
### Define the Problem
### If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.
### Ask the First "Why?"
### Ask your team why the problem is occurring.
### Know When to Stop
### Address the Root Cause(s)
### Monitor Your Measures
