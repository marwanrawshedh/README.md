## SQS and SNS are important components for scalable, large scale, distributed, cloud-based applications:
- SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe service.
- SQS is distributed queuing service.

## SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe system. Messages are pushed to subscribers as and when they are sent by publishers to SNS.
## SNS supports several end points such as email, sms, http end point and SQS. If you want unknown number and type of subscribers to receive messages, you need SNS.
